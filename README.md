Root My Galaxy is a one-click installer for explicitly
supported Samsung model and kernel combinations. The application itself is kept separate
from device offsets, native exploit payloads, and KernelSU build artifacts.


[Latest release](https://github.com/BuSung-dev/Root-My-Galaxy/releases)

The device feed and native payloads are maintained in
[Root-My-Galaxy-Payloads](https://github.com/BuSung-dev/Root-My-Galaxy-Payloads).

## Application

The app selects a payload whose model list and three-part kernel version match
the phone. For example, `6.6.98-android15-8-...` matches `6.6.98`. Advanced
mode filters the catalog by both values and allows manual selection with model
and kernel-version warnings.

Payload profiles may request a fresh same-process P0 session. For those exact
targets, the app disables its per-boot P0 cache and gives one combined
slide-discovery/exploit attempt the extended timeout declared by the app
policy; existing profiles retain the cached multi-attempt behavior.

## Build

Requirements:

- Android Studio JBR 21

- CMake 3.22.1

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME='C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr'
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

Output:

```text
app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Use only on devices you own or are explicitly authorized to test.
